# Understanding Drone Landing on the Human Body

## Jonas Auda, Martin Weigel, Jessica R. Cauchard and Stefan Schneegass

## Abstract
We envision the human body as a platform for fast take-off and landing of drones
in entertainment and professional uses such as medical emergencies, rescue missions,
or supporting police units. This new interaction modality challenges our knowledge
of human-drone experiences, in which interaction usually occurs at a distance from
the body. This work explores important factors for understanding the interplay between
drones and humans. We first investigated the suitability of various body locations
for landing in an online study (N = 159). Our results, presented as body maps, show
that the hand and upper back are particularly well-suited body locations. We further
tested these findings in a follow-up study (N = 12), in which participants experienced
drones landing on their bodies through carefully designed and pre-recorded 360°videos.
This immersion into the landing scenarios helped us to identify common themes and
research approaches for different body parts. Taken together, the findings provide
first insights into location preferences and themes for drones landing on the human
body.
